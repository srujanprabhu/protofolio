## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Add a custom domain later** - Buy domain, add to Vercel settings
2. **Monitor your site** - Vercel dashboard shows analytics & logs
3. **Keep dependencies updated** - Periodically run `npm update`
4. **Enable GitHub Pages** - For additional static content if needed
5. **Set up error tracking** - Consider Sentry (has free tier)

## 🚨 Important Notes

⚠️ **Security:**
- Never commit `.env` file (use environment variables)
- Keep DATABASE_URL secret
- Use Vercel's encrypted environment variables

⚠️ **Performance:**
- Build takes ~30-60 seconds
- First deployment takes longest
- Subsequent deployments are faster

⚠️ **Limits (More than enough for portfolio):**
- Vercel: 100GB bandwidth/month
- Neon: 3GB database storage
- Both have generous free tiers
